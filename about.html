  <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>I took a class in my freshman year of high school teaching how to make games with Java. I was hooked on programming ever since! I followed up with an AP computer science course my junior year, which also focused on Java programs that were not games. When I heard about the computer software engineering program at Thaddeus Stevens, I applied there and was accepted. I have since built a few projects for that course.
